Multiple AI models to make predictions and betting suggestions on the NBA

Odds and games are scraped from BetFair

Team statistics are scraped from BasketballReference and merged with games to create datasets for training

Team power rankings were also created with BasketballReference

Training was done using 3 different AI technologies
    - Sklearn
    - Keras
    - StableBaselines

Backtested games are graphed.

The best performing AI betting strategy was after 18 000 games (16 years) and betting a variable amount (under $100) on suitable games the bot made $3000 after betting on 3893 games.

I will continue this betting bot adding features and tweaking it a lot to continue progressing.
